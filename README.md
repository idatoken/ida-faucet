add your banners code into $header_banners,$footer_banners on the settings.php file.



>Can I add popups?

you can add your script codes into $popunders on the settings.php file.



>Can I add shorteners?

still in settings.php file, add them like this way :
```
$shorteners[]=''; //(this mean = no shortener on first claim)
$shorteners[]='https://shortit.pw/api.php?api=ReplaceThis&url='; // 2nd claim, we set a shortener
$shorteners[]='';  // we can decide to not add any shortener on 3th claim
$shorteners[]='https://shortit.pw/api.php?api=ReplaceThis&url=';  // you can replace it with any compatible shortener
```
you are supposed to add the equal lines of shorteners than your $ida_maxclaims (max claims per day) you set.



>All settings are in the file "settings.php".

You could change the theme colors, ban or unban ip, and be aware about new version of this script.
